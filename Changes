    - Option to use warranty text from different licenses, including a
      custom option. Thanks to apoc, who provided an intial
      implementation using a configuration option rather than
      subclasses.
    - Support can be added for new warranties by subclassing the main
      module and overriding two methods
    - Note that the main module will continue to work in exactly the
      same way as it has. Users are not required to select a specific
      subclass.
