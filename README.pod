=head1 NAME

Pod::Weaver::Section::WarrantyDisclaimer - Add a standard DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY section (for your Perl module)

=head1 VERSION

version 0.121290

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In F<weaver.ini>, probably near the end:

    [WarrantyDisclaimer]

=head1 OVERVIEW

This section plugin will add a standard B<DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY>
section to your POD. See the bottom of this module's documentation for
the content of this section.

Note that there are several other warranty texts available that
correspond to the text used in various open-source licenses, such as
L<Pod::Weaver::Section::WarrantyDisclaimer::GPL2>. If your code's
license has a specific warranty clause, you should try to use the
corresponding module, so that the warranty text in your modules will
match that of the license. If a warranty disclaimer module is not
provided for your license of choice, you can easily create one by
subclassing this class and overriding the methods
C<warranty_section_title> and C<warranty_text>. Alternatively, you can
simply use C<[WarrantyDisclaimer::Custom]> and then use the C<title>
and C<text> options to specify your custom warranty.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 warranty_section_title

This method provides the text to be used as the title of the warranty
section. It can be overridden by subclasses to provide different
warranties.

=head2 warranty_text

This method provides the text to be used in the warranty section. It
can be overridden by subclasses to provide different warranties.
