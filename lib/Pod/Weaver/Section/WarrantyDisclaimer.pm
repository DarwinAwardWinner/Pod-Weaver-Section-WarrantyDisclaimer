=head1 SYNOPSIS

In F<weaver.ini>, probably near the end:

    [WarrantyDisclaimer]

=head1 OVERVIEW

This section plugin will add a standard B<DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY>
section to your POD. See the bottom of this module's documentation for
the content of this section.

Note that there are several other warranty texts available that
correspond to the text used in various open-source licenses, such as
L<Pod::Weaver::Section::WarrantyDisclaimer::GPL2>. If your code's
license has a specific warranty clause, you should try to use the
corresponding module, so that the warranty text in your modules will
match that of the license. If a warranty disclaimer module is not
provided for your license of choice, you can easily create one by
subclassing this class and overriding the methods
C<warranty_section_title> and C<warranty_text>. Alternatively, you can
simply use C<[WarrantyDisclaimer::Custom]> and then use the C<title>
and C<text> options to specify your custom warranty.
